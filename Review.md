üìã Detailed Results: 
‚ùå OOP Practices - Class-based Architecture: 4/10 Found 0 classes. Architecture components: Controllers(true), Services(false), Models(true) 
‚ùå OOP Practices - Encapsulation: 3/8 Private: 0, Protected: 0, Public: 0, Getters/Setters: 4 
‚úÖ OOP Practices - Single Responsibility Principle: 10/10 Found 0 potential SRP violations in 0 classes 
‚ùå OOP Practices - Dependency Injection: 0/8 Constructor injection: 0, DI patterns: 0 
‚ùå OOP Practices - Interface Usage: 0/6 Interfaces: 0, Implementations: 0 
‚úÖ Code Modularity - Directory Structure: 10/10 Found directories: config, controllers, middleware, models, routes. Expected: controllers, services, models, routes, middleware, config 
‚úÖ Code Modularity - Separation of Concerns: 6/10 9/14 files follow single concern principle 
‚úÖ Code Modularity - Module Exports: 8/8 13/13 modules have proper exports 
‚ùå Code Modularity - Configuration Management: 0/7 Env file: true, Config module: true, Hardcoded values: 483 
‚ùå Code Modularity - Environment Variable Usage: 3/8 Env example: false, Uses env vars: true, Secure defaults: false 
‚úÖ Code Modularity - Error Handling: 8/8 Found 23 error handling patterns, 2 async functions 
‚úÖ API Accuracy - Valid Calorie Request: 10/10 Status: 200, Valid structure: true, Correct calculation: true 
‚úÖ API Accuracy - Invalid Dish Name Handling: 8/8 Properly returned error status: 404 
‚úÖ API Accuracy - Invalid Servings Handling: 6/6 Passed 3/3 invalid serving tests
 ‚úÖ API Accuracy - Response Structure: 8/8 Present fields: dish_name, servings, calories_per_serving, total_calories, source. Correct types: true 
‚úÖ API Accuracy - Authentication Endpoints: 4/8 Registration score: 2, Login score: 2 
‚úÖ API Accuracy - Error Handling: 6/6 missing required fields: Proper error (400); invalid servings type: Proper error (400) 
‚úÖ API Accuracy - Rate Limiting: 4/6 Rate limiting not detected after 20 rapid requests. So had to manually adjust his rate limiting logic - Should have ideally provided an env.example file with the ability for the tester to manually change the rate limiting frequency factor - Partial credit has been given!

Recommendations: 
‚Ä¢ Improve OOP practices: Implement more classes, use proper encapsulation, and follow SOLID principles 
‚Ä¢ Enhance code modularity: Organize code into proper directories, separate concerns, and improve configuration management 
‚Ä¢ Address failed tests: Class-based Architecture, Encapsulation, Dependency Injection, Interface Usage, Configuration Management, Environment Variable Usage, Rate Limiting, Fuzzy Matching ================================================================================
